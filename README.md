# Keno-DataVis
A program that gets data from Keno using an API for the purpose of displaying and interacting with the data. For now the program is in it's early stages, only a basic command line interface for now but there is alot planned. 

### Setup
Go to the [Keno-API pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/kenoAPI/) and follow instructions to download the package.
Once installed run the program by opening Main.py

### Credits
API Created by "JGolafshan" - Joshua Golafshan [API](https://github.com/JGolafshan/keno-api)

Win Data sourced from [Keno Game Guide](https://www.keno.com.au/keno-pdfs/VIC_Game%20Guide.pdf)\
*Data is sourced from the Victorian version, win amounts may differ in other states. In future other states will be added! This wont effect jackpots as that data is fetched from the API directly.*
