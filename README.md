### Setup 
**NOTE: WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN VERSIONS IT IS BEST TO DROP/DELETE THE MONGODB DATABASE**

0. Download all files for your version of choice, I Recommend either Latest Release or Last ActiveDev Branch Commit
1. Go to the [Keno-API pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/kenoAPI/) and follow instructions to download the package.
2. You also need the following packages, [Certifi](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/) and [Pymongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/)
3. Then Follow the Guide for your version (https://github.com/CatotronExists/Keno-DataVis/wiki)
4. Run Setup.py, if any errors occur repeat step 3 then open an issue with the 'help' label.
